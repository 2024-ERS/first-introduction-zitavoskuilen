# test with standard linear model (assuming normal error  distribution) 
# if plant species richness is different between the treatments 
# and account for block effects in the design, assuming it is a fixed effect
# first only a model with only block , "reference model"


# test with  linear mixed model (assuming normal error  distribution) 
# if plant species richness is different between the treatments 
# and account for block effects in the design, assuming it is a random effect
# first fit a model with only block


# fixed slopes model, assuming the treatment effect is the same for every block


# random slopes model, assume the treatment effect is different per block

# test with generalized linear mixed model (poisson distribution) 
# if plant species richness is different between the treatments 
# and account for block effects in the design, assuming it is a random effect
# (the correct assumption)

# first fit a model with only block


# add treatment to the model, assuming fixed slopes (i.e. treatment effect is the same for every block)

# add treatment to the model, now  assuming random slopes and intercepts (i.e. treatment effect is the different for every block)


# Test if the model with grazing treatment is a better model, by comparing it to the model with block 
# only, calculation the AIC of each model and testing the difference with a Chi-square test

# -> final conclusion? what should I do? Go lmer
